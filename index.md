Welcome to my academic research site. I am a survey scientist and data scientist at [Vox Pop Labs](https://www.voxpoplabs.com). I am also affiliated with the [Laurier Institute for the Study of Public Opinion and Policy (LISPOP)](https://lispop.ca) at [Wilfrid Laurier University](https://www.wlu.ca). You can email me [here](mailto:tgravelle@wlu.ca).

I was previously Senior Manager, Research Science at [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com) and earlier in my career a Senior Consultant at [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com).

My previous academic positions include Research Social Scientist (Senior Research Fellow) in the [Institute for Social Science Research](https://issr.uq.edu.au) at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au), and before that, a Lecturer in the [School of Social and Political Sciences](http://arts.unimelb.edu.au/ssps) at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au), and a Visiting Fellow at the [School of Government and Public Policy](https://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/governmentpublicpolicy/) at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk).

My research interests are public opinion and foreign policy, comparative public opinion and political behaviour (focusing on Canada, the United States, Europe, and Australia), spatial and contextual models of political behaviour, and applications of data science in the social sciences, policy research, and business. I received my PhD from the [Department of Government](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/government) at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk) where I was supervised by [Thomas Scotto](https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/persons/thomas-scotto/) (now at the University of Strathclyde).

My work has been published in several leading journals, including the [_American Political Science Review_](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055422000351), [_Public Opinion Quarterly_](https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfv054), [_Political Behavior_](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-025-10021-x), the [_European Journal of Political Research_](https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6765.12197), and [_Political_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2021.102499)[ _Geography_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2018.05.012).
