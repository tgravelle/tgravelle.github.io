I am a survey scientist, data scientist, and political scientist with interests across the fields of public opinion, political behaviour, international relations, and quantitative methods. My substantive interests are public opinion and foreign policy, comparative public opinion and political behaviour (focusing on Canada, the United States, Europe, and more recently Australia), and the spatial and geographic dimensions of policy attitudes. I am also broadly interested in applications of data science in the social sciences, policy research, and business.

I joined [Vox Pop Labs](https://www.voxpoplabs.com) as Director of Research in 2025. I am also affiliated with the [Laurier Institute for the Study of Public Opinion and Policy (LISPOP)](https://lispop.ca) at [Wilfrid Laurier University](https://www.wlu.ca), where I am an Adjunct Professor and a member of the board. I was previously Senior Manager, Research Science at [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com), and earlier in my career a Senior Consultant at [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com) where I served concurrently as Regional Director, North America for the [Gallup World Poll](https://www.gallup.com/178667/gallup-world-poll-work.aspx) and Statistician for the [Gallup Panel](https://www.gallup.com/174158/gallup-panel-methodology.aspx).

My previous academic positions include Research Social Scientist (Senior Research Fellow) in the [Institute for Social Science Research](https://issr.uq.edu.au) at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au), and before that, a Lecturer (equivalent to Assistant Professor) in the [School of Social and Political Sciences](https://arts.unimelb.edu.au/school-of-social-and-political-sciences) at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au). I have also been a Visiting Fellow at the [School of Government and Public Policy](https://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/governmentpublicpolicy/) at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk) in Glasgow, Scotland.

Through my private sector work experience, I have conducted predictive modeling, segmentation research, survey research and business intelligence research for organizations across a range of industries, including consumer products, hospitality, financial services, retail and aerospace, and also have experience conducting social research and evaluation research for government and intergovernmental organizations.

I received my PhD in the [Department of Government](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/government) at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk) where I was supervised by [Professor Thomas Scotto](https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/persons/thomas-scotto/) (now at the University of Strathclyde). I received my BA (Highest Honours; University Medal) in Political Science and MA in Political Economy from [Carleton University](https://www.carleton.ca) in Ottawa, Ontario. I have also studied at the [University of Wales, Aberystwyth](https://www.aber.ac.uk), the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), and have attended the [Summer Programme in Data Analysis (SPIDA)](https://www.yorku.ca/research/isr/) at York University.

My statistical expertise encompasses a range of tools, including linear and generalized linear models, latent variable models (confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, exploratory structural equation modeling, latent class analysis), multilevel modeling, multiple imputation and analysis of multiply-imputed data. I also have substantial practical expertise with survey sampling and weighting, and complex sample design. I have programming skills in R, Python, SAS, Stata, SPSS, Mplus and SQL.

Though I no longer use SAS on a day-to-day basis (having migrated to R and Python), I am a [SAS Certified Base Programmer](https://www.sas.com/en_ca/certification/credentials/foundation-tools/base-programming-specialist.html) and a [SAS Certified Statistical Business Analyst](https://www.sas.com/en_ca/certification/credentials/advanced-analytics/statistical-business-analyst.html).
